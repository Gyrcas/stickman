# Stickman
## Interesting things
I tried to emulate the style of old flash stickman games.
### Movement
I really like how I did the movement here. It is state based and is simple yet fun.

You can crouch.

You can slide, which is a faster and lower crouch but you need to be above a determined speed.

You can walljump

You can grab to ledge if you slide into one (Buggy)

If you crouch or slide before jumping, you jump higher.

If you hold down in the air or against a wall, you go down faster.

If you press down while grabbing a ledge, you will let go.
